**Query Parameters:**
- `/states/labels?labels=Heritage,Business` â€” Comma-separated list of labels to filter states.

**Notes:**
- All GET endpoints return state info with a `location` field containing `countryId` and `countryName`.
- The order of routes matters: `/labels` must be above `/:id` in the router.
